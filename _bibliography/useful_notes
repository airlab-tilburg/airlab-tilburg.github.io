Useful attributes:

If present in the bibtex, the following will:
  abstract={...}   ->  adds an "Abs" button that shows a textbox with the abstract on click

  url={}           -> adds "HTML" button that links to the url

  pdf={example.pdf} -> links to pdf under "assets/pdf/"

  preview={brownian-motion.gif}  -> img or gif; if present, it shows the thumbnail next to the paper


I think that:
  abbr={PhysRev} -> looks up "_data/venues.yml" for the journal abbreviation, and links to the website of the journal (+ makes a button link with specified color at the left of the paper!)
