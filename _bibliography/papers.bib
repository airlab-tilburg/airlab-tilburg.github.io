abstract={We introduce Proximal Policy Distillation (PPD), a novel policy distillation method that integrates student-driven distillation and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to increase sample efficiency and to leverage the additional rewards that the student policy collects during distillation. To assess the efficacy of our method, we compare PPD with two common alternatives, student-distill and teacher-distill, over a wide range of reinforcement learning environments that include discrete actions and continuous control (ATARI, Mujoco, and Procgen). For each environment and method, we perform distillation to a set of target student neural networks that are smaller, identical (self-distillation), or larger than the teacher network. Our findings indicate that PPD improves sample efficiency and produces better student policies compared to typical policy distillation approaches. Moreover, PPD demonstrates greater robustness than alternative methods when distilling policies from imperfect demonstrations. The code for the paper is released as part of a new Python library built on top of stable-baselines3 to facilitate policy distillation: https://github.com/spiglerg/sb3_distill},

abstract={Underactuation can enable low-cost, light-weight robotics. However, their design is challenging. While classical engineering intuition often leads to reasonable hardware and control choices that ensure basic functionality, the resulting performance is usually low. In contrast, purely data-driven co-evolution of hardware and software conventionally needs high computational effort to deliver meaningful results. We propose to leverage the advantages of both approaches by using classical intuitive controllers as proxies. As an example, we consider ``Fizzy,'' an underactuated robotic ball that leverages a unique single-motor configuration in combination with dynamic imbalance for movement. In a first optimization, an intuitive Virtual Model Control (VMC) proxy serves to quickly evaluate various design parameters like motor mass and axle positioning for a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The optimized configurations then serve as a foundation for training more sophisticated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controllers. Our methodology underscores the potential of integrating intuitive proxies with evolutionary algorithms to enhance the performance and efficiency of underactuated robotic systems, paving the way for more adaptable and cost-effective robotic designs.},
